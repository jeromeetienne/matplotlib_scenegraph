- transform fixed ? it seems so
  - clean it
- apply transform to transform mesh
- add more geometry shapes in `GeometryMeshShape`
  - box
  - sphere
  - plane
  - cylinder
  - grid - very useful for reference
- find a good API for the various materials
  - Q. do you do a Material class like in three.js ?
- find a good API for the various materials
  - the material can hook on the renderer loop
  - Q. do you do a Material class like in three.js ?
  - copy the one from three.js
  - LineMaterial
  - PointMaterial
  - SpriteMaterial
  - MeshBasicMaterial
  - MeshWireframeMaterial
  - MeshTextureMaterial
  - MeshNormalMaterial
- do you handle point light, directional light
- implement a `.serialization` ? to/from json ?
  - could easily be done
- bug in transform
  - how to fix it ? divide and conquer
  - find a test and ask AI to fix it
  - first orthoraphic camera, then perspective camera
  - first handle the object3d transform. local_transform, world_transform
    - how to test that ?
    - for translation, rotation, scale
  - once object3d transform is fixed, then do the camera transform 
- implement a .depth_sorting = true in renderer
  - where object3d is sorted by their world position and then rendered
  - NOTE: conflict with the delta rendering from the animation loop
    - make an options to remove the delta rendering in the animation loop


## Done
- DONE move the .lines_from_obj in Lines class method
  - `Lines.from_mesh_geometry(geometry)`
  - same for points
- DONE issue in object3d transform
  - just to a rotation around Z and it fails
- DONE animation loop decorator..
  - to avoid the weird `animation_loop.add_callback(lines_update)` all the time
- DONE animation loop remove the timestamp absolute
  - it look weird, cant find a good name
- DONE camera controller for awsd - advice for smoothness
  - must have a function in animation loop, else you do repeat from keyboard
  - you get a angular speed in seconds, position speed in seconds.
  - you read keyboard and maintain a {lateral: [-1,0,+1], vertical: [-1,0,+1], depth: [-1,0,+1], rotation_y: [-1,0,+1]}
  - in animation function, you use this and the world_matrix to update the camera 
- DONE modify the obj loader to use Geometry
  - to support 'non-meshio' obj files
- DONE implement the test layer from gsp_sc
  - require not to be interactive when i run the examples
  - require to save the matplotlib output
  - step 1: run all example in non interactive mode to check if there is exception
  - step 2: save the matplotlib output and compare it to a reference image
  - TODO ExamplesUtils.preamble() to set random seed if MPLSG_TESTING
  - TODO in animation loop, detect MPLSG_TESTING
    - if present, dont run the loop
    - save the output in a file, based on the example name
- DONE make a wireframe example with `Lines`
- DONE port `Geometry` everywhere in all `object3ds`
- DONE load a textured plane
  - for 3d oriented images
- DONE rename `RendererMatplotlib` to `Renderer`
- DONE make the texture example work again
- DONE move ./helpers in ./examples/common
- DONE make a sprite class
- DONE do the event in renderering
  - src/gsp/core/visual_base.py
  - allow to change the color based on depth
  - simulate a fog for various effect
  - do an example of protein with fog
  - it would help 
- DONE import suzanne model in .obj
- DONE Code various camera controller
  - first do you awsd camera
  - how to handle input events in matplotlib
  - awsd camera 
  - orbit camera
  - first person camera
- DONE remove ./matplotlib in ./renderer
  - there is only one renderer 
- DONE move it in iits own folder - matplotlib_sc for now ?
  - find a good name for it
