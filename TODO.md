- do the event in renderering
  - src/gsp/core/visual_base.py
  - allow to change the color based on depth
  - simulate a fog for various effect
  - do an example of protein with fog
- Do you implement geometry classes
  - you already got the .vertices in (n, 3) array
  - move that in a Geometry class ?
  - yeah i like it
  - load_mesh return a Geometry
  - .vertices
  - .indices
  - .normals
  - .uvs
- find a good API for the various materials
  - Q. do you do a Material class like in three.js ?
- find a good API for the various materials
  - the material can hook on the renderer loop
  - Q. do you do a Material class like in three.js ?
  - copy the one from three.js
  - LineMaterial
  - PointMaterial
  - SpriteMaterial
  - MeshBasicMaterial
  - MeshWireframeMaterial
  - MeshTextureMaterial
  - MeshNormalMaterial
- TODO move it in iits own folder - matplotlib_sc for now ?
  - find a good name for it
- Code various camera controller
  - first do you awsd camera
  - how to handle input events in matplotlib
  - awsd camera 
  - orbit camera
  - first person camera
- import suzanne model in .obj
- do you handle point light, directional light
- bug in transform
  - how to fix it ? divide and conquer
  - find a test and ask AI to fix it
  - first orthoraphic camera, then perspective camera
  - first handle the object3d transform. local_transform, world_transform
    - how to test that ?
    - for translation, rotation, scale
  - once object3d transform is fixed, then do the camera transform 
- implement a .depth_sorting = true in renderer
  - where object3d is sorted by their world position and then rendered
  - NOTE: conflict with the delta rendering from the animation loop
    - make an options to remove the delta rendering in the animation loop
- load a textured plane
  - for 3d oriented images
- make a sprite class
- implement various geometry builder
  - box YES
  - sphere YES
  - plane YES
  - torus
  - cylinder
  - cone
  - tube
  - torus knot
